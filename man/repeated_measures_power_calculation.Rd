\title{Calculate Power for Repeated Measures}
\usage{
repeated_measures_power_calculation(
  r_partial,
  n,
  alpha,
  correlation_between_measures,
  n_timepoints
)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_partial}{Partial correlation coefficient, analogous to sqrt(partial eta-squared) (NULL to calculate)}

\item{n}{Sample size (NULL to calculate)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default = 0.05)}

\item{correlation_between_measures}{Average correlation between measures (default = 0.5).}

\item{n_timepoints}{Number of repeated measures (default = 2). Note: engine uses paired t-test, best for 2 timepoints.}
}
\value{
Power analysis results with framework integration
