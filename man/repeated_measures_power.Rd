\usage{
repeated_measures_power(
  r_partial = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  power = NULL,
  n_timepoints = 2,

  alpha = 0.05,

}
\arguments{
\item{r_partial}{Partial correlation coefficient, analogous to sqrt(partial eta-squared) (NULL to calculate)}

\item{n}{Sample size (NULL to calculate)}

\item{power}{Statistical power (NULL to calculate, default = 0.8)}

\item{n_timepoints}{Number of repeated measures (default = 2). Note: engine uses paired t-test, best for 2 timepoints.}

\item{correlation_between_measures}{Average correlation between measures (default = 0.5).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default = 0.05)}

\item{discount_factor}{Conservative discount factor (default = 0.75)}

\item{effect_input}{Raw effect size input (alternative to r_partial)}

\item{effect_type}{Type of effect_input ("r", "d")}
}
