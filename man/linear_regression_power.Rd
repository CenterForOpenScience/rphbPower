\value{
A list object containing the power analysis results.

\description{
Performs a power analysis for a single coefficient in a multiple linear
regression model using the pwr package, which is based on Cohen's f-squared.

\section{Planning for Multicollinearity}{

The \code{r_partial} argument is the cornerstone of this analysis. It represents the expected partial correlation between your predictor of interest and the outcome, \emph{after controlling for all other predictors in the model}.

It is critical \strong{not} to use a simple zero-order correlation for this argument if your model contains multiple predictors. Doing so will result in a highly optimistic and likely inaccurate power analysis because it fails to account for the variance your predictor shares with the other covariates. A higher degree of multicollinearity will lead to a smaller partial correlation, which will require a larger sample size.
