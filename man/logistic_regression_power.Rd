\arguments{
\item{r_partial}{Partial correlation coefficient (NULL to calculate).}

\item{n}{Sample size (NULL to calculate).}

\item{power}{Statistical power (NULL to calculate, default = 0.8).}

\item{n_predictors}{Number of predictors. (NOTE: Kept for compatibility, but the current engine only supports a single predictor).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default = 0.05).}

\item{discount_factor}{Conservative discount factor (default = 0.75).}

\item{mc_reps}{Kept for compatibility, unused by the new engine.}

\item{search_reps}{Kept for compatibility, unused by the new engine.}

\item{effect_input}{Raw effect size input (alternative to r_partial).}

\item{effect_type}{Type of \code{effect_input} ("r", "d", "f2", "r_squared").}
}
\value{
A list object containing the power analysis results.
