\title{Internal Simulation Engine for Multiple Logistic Regression}
\usage{
logistic_multi_predictor_sim_engine(r_partial, n, n_predictors, alpha, n_sims)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_partial}{The partial correlation of the target predictor, after any discounts.}

\item{n}{The sample size for the simulation run.}

\item{n_predictors}{The total number of predictors in the model.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (alpha).}

\item{n_sims}{The number of simulations to run for the power estimation.}
}
\value{
Estimated statistical power (a single numeric value).
}
\description{
This is an internal helper function that runs a Monte Carlo simulation
to estimate power for a logistic regression model with one or more predictors.
It is not intended for direct use.
