)

library(rphbPower)
```

A hands-on tutorial for the partial correlation framework enabling power analysis across correlation, logistic/linear regression, mediation, SEM, multilevel, and longitudinal methods.

## Quick Setup

### Installation and Initialization

The package can be installed directly from the Center For Open Science GitHub repository.

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # Run this if you don't have devtools
devtools::install_github("CenterForOpenScience/rphbPower", build_vignettes = TRUE)

library(rphbPower)
```

### First Power Analysis

```{r first_power_analysis, eval=FALSE}
# Basic power analysis (provide any 2 parameters, calculates the 3rd)
result <- linear_regression_power(r_partial = 0.25, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 1)
result$n  # Required sample size: 120

result <- linear_regression_power(r_partial = 0.25, n = 120, n_predictors = 1) 
result$power  # Achieved power: ~0.8

result <- linear_regression_power(n = 192, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 1)
result$r_partial  # Detectable effect size: ~0.20
```

## Core Framework Concepts

### Unified Effect Size Metric

All analyses use partial correlations as the standardized effect size, enabling direct comparison across methods:

```{r unified_effect_size, eval=FALSE}
# Same effect size across different analysis types
effect_r <- 0.25  # Medium effect in any analysis

# Linear regression
linear_result <- linear_regression_power(r_partial = effect_r, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 1)

# Compare with correlation
corr_result <- correlation_power(r_partial = effect_r, power = 0.8)

# Sample size comparison - the results are nearly identical
linear_result$n  # 120
corr_result$n    # 122
```

### Conservative Planning with Discount Factor

The framework applies a 0.75 discount factor by default for realistic planning:

```{r conservative_planning, eval=FALSE}
# Framework integration automatically applies discount
literature_d <- 0.4  # Cohen's d from literature

# Method 1: Effect input with main function (recommended)
result1 <- linear_regression_power(
  effect_input = literature_d,
  effect_type = "d",        # Converts d → partial r with discount
  power = 0.8,
  n_predictors = 2
)

# Method 2: Manual conversion
r_discounted <- framework_effect_size(literature_d, "d", apply_discount = TRUE)
result2 <- linear_regression_power(r_partial = r_discounted, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 2)

# Both give same result with conservative planning
# d=0.4 becomes r≈0.15 after discount, requiring ~273 participants for a 2-predictor model
```

### Effect Size Conversions

Convert any effect size type to the framework standard:

```{r effect_conversions, eval=FALSE}
# From literature with mixed effect size types
cohen_d <- 0.5
cohens_f2 <- 0.15
r_squared <- 0.09

# Convert all to framework partial correlations
r_from_d <- framework_effect_size(cohen_d, "d", apply_discount = TRUE)      # ≈0.184
r_from_f2 <- framework_effect_size(cohens_f2, "f2", apply_discount = TRUE)  # ≈0.318
r_from_r2 <- framework_effect_size(r_squared, "r_squared", apply_discount = TRUE) # ≈0.260

# Use any of these in power analysis - sample sizes will vary based on the specific effect size
linear_regression_power(r_partial = r_from_d, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 3)$n  # ~227
```

## Progressive Examples

### Example 1: Simple Correlation Study

```{r example_correlation, eval=FALSE}
# Research question: Is there a relationship between X and Y?
# Expected correlation from pilot study
pilot_r <- 0.30

# Calculate required sample size for 80% power
result <- correlation_power(r_partial = pilot_r, power = 0.8)
result$n  # Required sample size: 84

# Check power with limited resources
power_check <- correlation_power(r_partial = pilot_r, n = 100)
power_check$power  # Achieved power with n=100: ~0.87
```

### Example 2: Multiple Regression Study

```{r example_regression, eval=FALSE}
# Research question: Do personality factors predict job performance?
# Expected effect from meta-analysis (Cohen's d = 0.35)
meta_d <- 0.35
n_personality_factors <- 5

# Framework approach with automatic conversion
result <- linear_regression_power(
  effect_input = meta_d,
  effect_type = "d",
  power = 0.8,
  n_predictors = n_personality_factors
)

result$n  # Required sample size: ~460
result$r_partial  # Framework effect size used: ~0.13 (after discount)
result$effect_size_conversions  # All effect size metrics
```


### Example 3: Logistic Regression Study

The `logistic_regression_power` function uses a simulation engine and supports two workflows.

**Workflow 1: Direct Replication (Default)**

Use this when you have a **partial odds ratio** from a similar prior study. The function defaults to `inter_predictor_cor = 0` to correctly estimate power for that specific partial effect without applying a "double penalty."

```{r example_logistic_replication, eval=FALSE}
# Replicate a finding where the partial OR was 1.75 in a 3-predictor model.
result <- logistic_regression_power(
  effect_input = 1.75,
  effect_type = "or",
  power = 0.8,
  n_predictors = 3
)
result$n
```

**Workflow 2: Novel Study with Correlated Predictors**
Use this when planning a new study. You provide a simple (zero-order) OR and then explicitly model the expected multicollinearity.

```{r ex3.2}
# Plan a new study expecting a simple OR of 1.75, but where predictors
# are correlated at r = 0.3.
result_novel <- logistic_regression_power(
  effect_input = 1.75,
  effect_type = "or",
  power = 0.8,
  n_predictors = 3,
  inter_predictor_cor = 0.3 # Explicitly model the correlation
)
# The required sample size will be higher.
result_novel$n

```


### Example 4: Mediation Analysis

```{r example_mediation, eval=FALSE}
# Research question: Does self-efficacy mediate training → performance?
# Path coefficients from theory
r_a <- 0.40  # Training → self-efficacy  
r_b <- 0.35  # Self-efficacy → performance (controlling training)

# Power analysis for the indirect effect to find the required sample size
result <- mediation_regression_power(
  r_a = r_a, 
  r_b = r_b, 
  power = 0.8,
  n = NULL # <- We are solving for N
)

result$n  # Required sample size: ~194
result$indirect_effect  # Expected indirect effect size after discount: ~0.079
```

## Cross-Method Comparison

The unified framework allows you to compare sample size requirements across different potential study designs for the same core effect.

```{r cross_method_comparison, eval=FALSE}
# We expect a partial correlation of r = 0.25 from prior research.
# We want to plan a replication with 80% power.
planning_r <- 0.25

# Approach 1: Simple correlation
corr_n <- correlation_power(r_partial = planning_r, power = 0.8)$n

# Approach 2: Regression with 2 additional covariates
reg_n <- linear_regression_power(r_partial = planning_r, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 3)$n

# Approach 3: A multilevel study (e.g., daily diary)
# We'll calculate power for N=200, assuming it's a direct replication
# of the r_partial = 0.25 finding (so inter_predictor_cor = 0).
ml_result <- mixed_models_power(
  r_partial = planning_r,
  n_groups = 40,
  n_per_group = 5, # Total N = 200
  test_level = "level1",
  icc = 0.2,
  inter_predictor_cor = 0 # Use default for direct replication
)
ml_power <- ml_result$power

# Compare results
data.frame(
  Method = c("Correlation", "Regression (3 pred)", "Multilevel (N=200)"),
  Result = c(
    paste("N =", corr_n),
    paste("N =", reg_n),
    paste("Power =", round(ml_power, 2))
  )
)
```


## Literature Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Mixed Effect Sizes

```{r literature_step1, eval=FALSE}
# Multiple studies with different metrics
studies <- data.frame(
  Study = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
  Effect = c(0.4, 0.12, 0.08, 2.1),  # d, R², f², t-statistic
  Type = c("d", "r_squared", "f2", "t_stat"),
  Sample_Size = c(120, 200, 180, 89),
  DF = c(NA, NA, NA, 87)  # For t-statistic conversion
)
```

### Step 2: Convert to Framework Standard

```{r literature_step2, eval=FALSE}
# Convert each study to partial correlation
r_values <- numeric(nrow(studies))

for (i in 1:nrow(studies)) {
  if (studies$Type[i] == "t_stat") {
    # Convert t-statistic to partial correlation
    r_values[i] <- partial_correlation_from_t(studies$Effect[i], studies$DF[i])
  } else {
    # Convert other effect sizes
    r_values[i] <- framework_effect_size(studies$Effect[i], studies$Type[i], apply_discount = TRUE)
  }
}

# Meta-analytic average (simple mean for demonstration)
meta_r <- mean(r_values)
# Result: meta_r ≈ 0.226 after framework discount
```

### Step 3: Power Analysis with Meta-Effect

```{r literature_step3, eval=FALSE}
# Use meta-analytic effect for planning
meta_result <- linear_regression_power(
  r_partial = meta_r, 
  power = 0.8, 
  n_predictors = 4
)

meta_result$n  # Sample size based on literature synthesis: ~149
```

## Framework Best Practices

### Effect Size Selection

```{r best_practices_effect_size, eval=FALSE}
# Create comprehensive conversion table
effect_values <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8)  # Small, medium, large Cohen's d

conversion_table <- unified_effect_size_table(
  effect_values = effect_values,
  input_type = "d",
  apply_discount = TRUE
)

print(conversion_table)  # Shows all conversions with framework discount
# Corrected Results: d of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 become r of ~0.075, 0.184, 0.287 after discount
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

```{r sensitivity_analysis, eval=FALSE}
# Test multiple scenarios for realistic planning
scenarios <- c(0.15, 0.20, 0.25)  # Conservative, moderate, optimistic

sensitivity_results <- data.frame(
  Effect_Size = scenarios,
  Sample_Size_1_Pred = sapply(scenarios, function(r) {
    linear_regression_power(r_partial = r, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 1)$n
  }),
  Sample_Size_3_Pred = sapply(scenarios, function(r) {
    linear_regression_power(r_partial = r, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 3)$n
  })
)

print(sensitivity_results)
# Corrected results:
# r=0.15: 345 (1 pred), 347 (3 pred)
# r=0.20: 188 (1 pred), 190 (3 pred)  
# r=0.25: 120 (1 pred), 122 (3 pred)
```

### Model Complexity Planning - CRITICAL INSIGHT

```{r model_complexity, eval=FALSE}
# How does predictor count affect sample size?
base_effect <- 0.20
predictor_counts <- c(1, 3, 5, 8, 12)

complexity_results <- data.frame(
  Predictors = predictor_counts,
  Sample_Size = sapply(predictor_counts, function(p) {
    linear_regression_power(r_partial = base_effect, power = 0.8, n_predictors = p)$n
  }),
  Increase_Percent = NA
)

# Calculate percentage increases
complexity_results$Increase_Percent[1] <- 0  # Baseline
for (i in 2:nrow(complexity_results)) {
  complexity_results$Increase_Percent[i] <- 
    round((complexity_results$Sample_Size[i] / complexity_results$Sample_Size[1] - 1) * 100)
}

print(complexity_results)
# Corrected results for r=0.20:
# 1 pred: 188 (0% increase)
# 3 pred: 190 (+1% increase)
# 5 pred: 192 (+2% increase)
# 8 pred: 195 (+4% increase)
# 12 pred: 199 (+6% increase)
```

## Statistical Test Integration

### Converting Existing Results

```{r statistical_integration, eval=FALSE}
# From regression output: t(147) = 3.2 for key predictor
pilot_r <- partial_correlation_from_t(t_value = 3.2, df = 147)
# Result: r ≈ 0.255

# From correlation matrix (controlling for Z)
pilot_r_2 <- partial_correlation_from_zero_order(
  r_xy = 0.45,  # X-Y correlation
  r_xz = 0.30,  # X-Z correlation  
  r_yz = 0.25   # Y-Z correlation
)
# Result: r ≈ 0.406

# Use converted effect in any analysis
linear_regression_power(r_partial = pilot_r_2, power = 0.8, n_predictors = 2)$n
# Result: ~42
```

## Advanced Framework Features

### Framework Validation

```{r framework_validation, eval=FALSE}
# Validate effect size inputs
r_input <- 0.85  # Suspiciously large
r_clean <- validate_partial_r(r_input, allow_zero = FALSE)
# Note: This function stops on invalid r (e.g. >=1), but does not warn.

# Effect size interpretation
interpretation <- interpret_effect_size(0.25, standard = "cohen")
interpretation  # "Small" effect by Cohen's standards
```

### Framework Summary Reports

```{r framework_summary, eval=FALSE}
# Comprehensive effect size summary
summary <- framework_conversion_summary(
  effect_value = 0.4, 
  input_type = "d", 
  apply_discount = TRUE
)

print(summary)  
# Shows: input d=0.4, framework r≈0.15, all conversions, interpretation
```

## Planning Reality Checks

### Sample Size Expectations by Field

- **Psychology correlations**: Expect 100-400 participants for typical effects
- **Education interventions**: Expect 200-800 participants for meaningful effects
- **Medical research**: Expect 500-2000 participants for population-level effects
- **Business analytics**: Expect 150-600 participants for organizational effects

## Framework Benefits

- **Conservative estimates**: 0.75 discount prevents underpowered studies
- **Cross-method consistency**: Same r_partial enables direct comparison
- **Model complexity awareness**: Automatically accounts for additional predictors
- **Literature integration**: Converts any effect size type to common metric
- **Validated and Fast Engines**: Uses fast analytical formulas where possible, and robust Monte Carlo simulations for complex models (like logistic regression) where analytical solutions are less accurate.

## Next Steps

### For Simple Studies

1. Choose analysis method based on research design
2. Convert literature effects to partial correlations using framework functions
3. Calculate sample size with 80% power and conservative discount
4. Plan for attrition (add 10-20% to framework estimate)

### For Complex Studies

- **Multiple methods**: Compare sample size requirements across approaches using unified metrics
- **Model complexity**: Account for substantial increases with additional predictors
- **Longitudinal designs**: Explore repeated measures, cross-lagged, or fixed effects approaches
- **Mediation/SEM**: Use dedicated functions for indirect effects and structural models
